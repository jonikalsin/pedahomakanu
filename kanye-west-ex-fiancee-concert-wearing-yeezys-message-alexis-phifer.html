The rap mogul’s ex-fiancee, <strong>Alexis Phifer</strong>, decided to go under the radar by attending his Los Angeles gig, that is until she took to social media with a pic of herself in skin-tight leather pants and a pair of Yeezys. Fans quickly speculated&nbsp;that Kanye gave her the pricey sneakers as a gift, wondering if she was starting drama or showing support.&nbsp;The former flames did have a lot of history, since&nbsp;they allegedly dated on-and-off for six years, first becoming exclusive in 2002.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>[jwplatform kGHu17w5-RiPpdJ98]</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The “famous” lyricist proposed to Alexis during a romantic vacation to Capri in 2006, reportedly popping&nbsp;the question while they dined&nbsp;on lobster and pasta.
