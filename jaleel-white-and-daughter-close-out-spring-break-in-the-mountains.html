The teen is in middle school and learning about the wonders of adolescence. It was just the other week that Jaleel took to Instagram to talk about the April Fools joke Samaya played on him at the top of the month.</p><p>“So I decide to bring ice cream home as a surprise,” White began the story. “I look down and see Ms. Seventh Grade has gotten herself a colorful array of video vixen acrylic nails,” Jaleel said of his daughter’s appearance. “And we TALKED ABOUT THIS and how it was NOT allowed,” Jaleel shared along with an angry emoji.</p><p>“I’m immediately HEATED but I stay chill. Why did you do this behind my back? I just wanna know what made you do it? And how would you handle it if you were me and I was the daughter here? I’m super chill about it. No yelling at all,” Jaleel explained. “I see her and my gal glancing at each other… these foolz (sic) have taped FAKE Acrylic nails to her fingernails just to see what I would do ??????? #wellplayed.”</p><p>Photo: Jaleel White/Instagram</p><p><span class="post-views-icon dashicons dashicons-chart-bar"></span><br><span class=post-views-label>Post Views:</span><br><span class=post-views-count>182</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOo5ilnZWheri0yK2cZpmemXqlrdSgn62domKwrbvSnmSoraRiwLG%2ByKeeZpqimq6secinZK2glWK6sMHNrZiipqNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
