If you stop him playing, they're really gonna to miss him, we won't miss you so much but they're gonna miss him!'</p><p>"They're in the tunnel and Vinnie's pointing over to Gazza and goes 'oi, you Fatboy!

Vinnie had a long throw and it was part of our armoury and during the game because we had a throw-in in the final third and Vinnie goes 'oi Gazza, I've got to take the throw-in. Stay there, don't move and I'll be back.'</p><p>"And literally Gazza is stood there and waiting for him to come back!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifKe7zq2ZmqScZIVygZBxZ2iumaO7qrGMo6annaNiwaa%2F06KapZ1dnL%2BiroygmLOykWK7sMCMn6Crq6RisK2t0qFknZmmmnqjscCsmKesXZ22ra3Roqauq12owbC%2B2Gg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
