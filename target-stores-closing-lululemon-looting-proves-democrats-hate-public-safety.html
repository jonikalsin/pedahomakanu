Retail flight is a sign of the decline of a neighborhood, and maybe a city.</p><p>It takes a real toll on shoppers as well as workers who depend on the stores for their jobs.</p><p>And it can lead to violence.</p><p>Nor are the thieves impoverished Jean Valjeans, stealing a loaf of bread to survive: A National Retail Federation report this week cited “organized retail crime perpetrators” behind the thefts — often fomenting violence.</p><p>The hit on these stores nationwide is huge: <a href=#>“Shrink” cost them</a> $112.1 billion in retail losses last year, up from $93.9 billion in 2021, a 19% spike.</p><p>And the crooks are growing ever bold: In Philadelphia Tuesday, a group of young <a href=#>looters — who outnumbered cops — hit several outlets</a> in the same night, including Apple, Foot Locker and Lululemon stores.</p><p>There’s no mystery about <a href=#>what’s driving the surge</a>: It coincides with the dramatic elimination of consequences for criminals — especially low-level repeat offenders — in cities with Democratic leaders and DAs over the past few years.</p><p>In New York, the state no-bail and Raise the Age laws, along with restrictive “discovery” rules for prosecutors and a host of state and city handcuffs on cops, all contributed.</p><p>Plus the rise of pro-criminal DAs like Manhattan’s Alvin Bragg — who proudly boasted on his first day in office that he’d avoid imposing consequences on lawbreakers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As the National Supermarket Association’s <a href=#>Seny Taveras notes</a>, the perps in these cases are mostly recidivists: Of 14,877 shoplifting arrestees in the city this year through July, 64.5% had been nabbed before for shoplifting.</p><p>The chief problem: Progressives just don’t care about crime’s consequences for the public.</p><p>No stores, no jobs — so what? As long as criminals don’t get “victimized.”</p><p>Residents who see stores like Target flee need to remember that attitude come election time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma29fqa6zs8StZKysn6eytHnCpaasoZ6ceq3By66jnqWfo3qtu86toKefXaW%2FsMLErGSdnZ2ksLOt06xkoZmkmnqxwcGloJxlo5azpsDYaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
