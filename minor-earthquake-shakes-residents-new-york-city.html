There were no initial reports of damage or injuries from the seismic activity.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Residents in New York and New Jersey described the quake's impact as dramatic and noticeable, though it did not cause any damage.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Yonkers, NY, resident Sophia Balaj told ABC News that the quake produced a loud rumble for a few seconds, noticeable enough to prompt all the members of the video call she was on to ask each other if they felt the same shaking.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Englewood, NJ, resident Erica Diggs, a military veteran who completed two deployments to Iraq, compared the feeling of the earthquake to a mortar.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"What it felt like was a mortar, and what it sounded like was a mortar."

"And then I thought, oh my god, is there a bomb explosion nearby?"</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Like Solin, many residents near New York City took to social media early Friday morning to ask if others had felt a similar shake.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Earthquakes near New York City are relatively uncommon, though the occasional tremor has impacted the region.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">A 5.8 earthquake struck Virginia in <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>2011</a>, sending noticeable tremors up the eastern seaboard, including New York City.
