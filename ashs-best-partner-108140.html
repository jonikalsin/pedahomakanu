And don't forget that it was Iris who secured Ash his second <i>and</i> third battle with Trip in the first place</p><p>What injured pokémon? When the group come across an injured pokémon, all three show concern. Of course, it's going to be Ash who caries out helping the pokémon most of the time, him being the main character and all.</p><p>Not to mention Iris and Cilan participate most of the time.</p><p>Xenophobic? How is Iris in anyway Xenophobic?</p><p>How <i>could</i> Iris help Ash during a gym battle anyway? Unless you meant to say Lenora, in which case I admit, Iris could have been a bit more helpful.</p><p>But both of them were supportive and told him what he should improve on to defeat Lenora.</p><p>Admittedly, Iris is clearly a proud character, but that only proves she isn't two-dimensional</p><p>She isn't xenophobic! Nor is she a snob! She showed pity over Tepig in BW004, she helped Amy train her Druddigon in BW030 and she finally overcame Excadrill in BW036... not to mention she showed high amounts of character in that episode.</p><p>I mean Iris can relate to Ash's past female partners. She, like Misty, has a very strong character and finds fun in teasing Ash at times.</p><p>Like May she has her irrational fears over the silliest of things. (Ice type Pokémon)</p><p>And like Dawn, she has had to overcome the challenge of training a disobedient pokémon.</p><p>And yet, she still stands out far from the crowd.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyiv8esZJudo6l6sa3RraWeql5mfXl9k2lmqZmXmnpz</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
