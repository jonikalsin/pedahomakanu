Their first encounter took place in Northern Serbia when the band’s frontman approached her after noticing her in the audience. Surprisingly, the two clicked right away on their first date and recognized they were attracted to each other. Jibri and Miona’s relationship swiftly progressed from casual to serious. Because of their mutual understanding and affection for one other, the pair were engaged.</p><p>They also used social media to emphasize their relationship’s best qualities. Jibri proposed to her in Thailand in 2019 shortly after. She posted on her IG, “My heart almost exploded that day when the love of my life proposed to me! I’m so grateful for having you in my life Jibri! Thank you for loving me so selflessly and accepting me for who I am. Thank you for making our life and love a continual adventure. I’m looking forward to spending forever with you.”</p><p>Bringing his wife to America, however, was neither simple nor inexpensive. As a result, Jibri relocated from California to South Dakota, his home state. He’s currently residing with his family, who have more stringent rules regarding Miona’s presence. His mother wants that she dress more conservatively in photos than in real life. Miona, on the other hand, is unhappy with the situation.</p><p>Miona was enamored with Jibri’s lavish lifestyle and desired to live in California. The Serbian citizen, on the other hand, had not anticipated his return to South Dakota. She expressed her anxiety that she had made a mistake and indicated that she had no intention of living in such a little place.</p><p>Miona felt betrayed when Jibri proposed a wedding in his hometown rather than a beach wedding in California. Miona said, “When you tell me about getting married there, that sounds even worse than living in South Dakota.” She found it difficult to live in South Dakota and proposed to either choose her or his family while putting Jibri on the spot.</p><h3><strong>90 Day Fiance: Are Miona Bell And Jibri Still Together?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Miona Bell and Jibri Bell from 90 Day Fiance are still together. Not only that, but according to the article we found, they are already married. After the death of George Floyd in the United States in 2020, he was highlighted on Telegraf.rs, a local news service in Serbia.</p><p>According to the article, Jibri AKA Jovan Crnovic in Serbia fled the states after the racial unrest in America. He didn’t feel safe in his skin hence he fled to Serbia and decided to take refuge from adversity by going to the only country where he is free – Serbia.</p><p>The article addressed Miona Bell as his wife, who appeared as Telegraf’s guest and spoke to the outlet about the unrest in the United States, racism, and the horrific death of George Floyd.</p><p>During the interview, Jibri confirmed, “But then when I came here… this has been my second home. My wife (Fiona)’s Serbian, and my life’s Serbian, and everything Serbian to me is right. Serbia is my second home and I want everyone to see and see how open and friendly it is here.”</p><p>Miona and Jibri appear to be a peculiar couple whose drama of where they will live will be televised on TLC rather than the issues related to getting married because they already did.</p><h3><strong>Miona Bell Age</strong></h3><p>At the time of filming the show in 2021, Miona Bell was 23 years old.</p><h3><strong>Miona Bell Job</strong></h3><p>Miona Bell is a make-up artist and social media influencer working in Niš, a city in Serbia.

She was recently called out for “blackfishing” after old photos of Serbian beauty were discovered on Instagram.</p><p>Miona’s amateurish attempt to cosplay Black swag left people scratching their heads and shouting foul about her unconvincing counterfeit Kardashian/ Jenner look, terrible spray tan, and bronzer combo, and bad wigs (also known as Blackfishing). To make matters worse, her Black beau’s obvious longing for whiteness – as well as his constant identification as “biracial” — irritated viewers of 90 Day Fiance.</p><p>On the other hand, viewers were interested to know about her origin because of her darker skin tone. Miona claimed that her past is a mystery and could be part of her 90-Day Fiancé storyline. Some admirers speculate that Miona’s beauty and her thick curly hair are the results of her parents or ancestors immigrating to Serbia from another nation.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Miona Bell Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Reportedly, Miona Bell celebrates her birthday on 17 June.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Tall Is Miona Bell?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Miona Bell stands tall under 5 feet 5 inches.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Much Is Miona Bell Net Worth?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Miona Bell should have a net worth under $100 thousand.</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmpqGfo65ursSlo2aamaR6psDHp6CcoaSueq6tyJ2cp2WelrqmecmomWZxYGKxosWMn6CappOafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
