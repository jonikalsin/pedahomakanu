On Sunday, he bounced back and shocked viewers with his victory over the Norwegian five-time World Chess Champion.</span></p><p><span>“I’m just really happy,” Pragg said in an interview with </span><span>Chess24</span><span>. “I think yesterday wasn’t so good.

He also became the youngest international master at the age of 10 in 2016.</span><p><span>When asked about his victory celebration, Pragg noted the time difference and said, “It’s about time to go to bed, as I don’t think I will have dinner at 2:30 in the morning.”</span></p><p><span>Defeated player Carlsen attributed his blunders to the lingering effects of COVID-19. He had reportedly tested positive before the tournament, according to </span><span>NPR</span><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It’s been pretty bad. I played a couple of decent games, but the rest of them have been poor.
