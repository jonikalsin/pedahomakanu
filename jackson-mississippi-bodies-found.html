The bodies were not treated with the respect they deserved; they were not embalmed, provided with coffins, or properly buried. Inmates were responsible for digging the graves, and it is suspected that the burials were carried out by the same prisoners.</p><p>One activist, Arthur “Silky Slim” Reed, has been vocal about the appalling conditions at the burial site.

She spent seven months searching for her middle child, Dexter Wade, who mysteriously disappeared in March 2023. It wasn’t until October 2023 that Bettersten learned the truth about her son’s fate.
