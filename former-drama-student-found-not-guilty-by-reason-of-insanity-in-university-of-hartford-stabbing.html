However, he also determined that Wascher’s lawyer proved that he lacked criminal capacity due to mental disease or defect.</p><p>Wascher is “in the midst of a psychotic episode and suffered from paranoid delusions" that the victims were out to harm him,” the judge ruled.</p><p>Wascher and two other students were at a campus apartment when the stabbing happened, police said. Both were transported to area hospitals - one in critical condition, the other stable - for treatment of wounds suffered as the three reportedly acted out a scene from a movie for a class assignment.</p><p>Both students suffered stab wounds to their chest and back, police noted. Wascher initially fled the apartment on foot before being apprehended. He was later treated for non-life-threatening injuries as a precaution.</p><p>“We are deeply saddened by the serious incident involving the assault of two students on campus this afternoon,” the University posted in a statement following the stabbing. “The injured students were immediately transported to area hospitals for treatment and law enforcement secured campus. A third student (Wascher) was located off-campus and has been taken into police custody. Our thoughts are with these students and their families during this difficult time.</p><p class=e-click-here-follow-btn data-testid=bottom-paragraph><a class=e-email-signup js-follow-button data-testid=article-click-here-to-subscribe href=#>Click here</a> to follow Daily Voice Fairfield and receive free news updates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmickZ65usLOopqeZpOkunCvzqelnpuknrC2wI6fmKKqlp6yrbCOp5ywq1%2BbvLO5xKtknaqRoq5uv9Oum56mpGKzsMHNnWSnp6RitLa1y62wZpqpYr%2BmrdKopWanlmK2r7%2FAp6CtsV2eu27BzaKtnqqjnsG6ec6fZKGZoqmzsL7DZqqtmZKXtq%2BzjnBucWljaHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
