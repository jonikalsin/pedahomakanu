I’ve lived a very charmed life. Now I have some challenges ahead of me. But, I have comfort in knowing the chemotherapy is to ensure that cancer does not come back.”</p><p>The sporting champion – who underwent a “preventive hysterectomy” in December 2021 after her sister Jeanne died from the same type of cancer in February 2020 – went on to speak about how the diagnosis had left her “in a daze.”</p><p>She said: “I was in a daze. I just couldn’t believe it. I had been working out, doing CrossFit, playing tennis. I didn’t feel anything different. When I go into chemo, Jeanne is my inspiration, I’ll be thinking of her. And she’ll get me through it.”</p><p>Chris then went on to offer health advice to readers and fans, urging them to make sure they are aware of family history and to follow their gut instincts.</p><p>She wrote: “Be your own advocate. Know your family’s history. Have total awareness of your body, follow your gut and be aware of changes. Don’t try to be a crusader and think this will pass.”</p><p>Chris later took to Twitter to release a statement in which she reasoned her decision to share her diagnosis with the world, admitting she felt “very lucky” that the cancer was noticed in its early stages.</p><p>She said: ” I wanted to share my stage 1 ovarian cancer diagnosis and the story behind it as a way to help others,” she wrote. “I feel very lucky that they caught it early and expect positive results from my chemo plan.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOnJ%2BroaNisrex0a1koqtdl661wMuipaBln6uus7XAp2ScmZ6YsrN7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
