Shakespeare in Love, Midsomer Murders, Conspiracy, and Doctor Who are just a few of his notable acting roles.</strong></p><p><strong>His love of performing not only helped him build a successful career but also brought him and his wife together.</strong></p><p><strong>Because Barnaby and his wife enjoy performing and each other so much, they frequently co-star in movies.</strong></p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></p><h2>Who Is the Wife of Barnaby Kay?</h2><p>Nicola Walker, a well-known actress, is Barnaby Kay’s wife. With the addition of their son, Harry Kay, the couple, who were <strong>married in 2013</strong>, went from being a pair to a family of three.</p><figure id=attachment_1436313 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-1436313 style=width:650px class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding=async src alt="Barnaby Kay" width=650 height=400 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Barnaby Kay With His Wife(Source: Alchetron)</strong></figure><p>The fact that their romance lasted longer than their marriage is interesting. The two struck up a romance after meeting on the sets of<strong> “The Libertine.”</strong></p><p>Their relationships progressed from days to months to years, and they eventually approached their <strong>20th wedding anniversary</strong>, but Nicola was still without a ring.</p><p>You could now believe that the actress from<strong> “Spook”</strong> was a little letdown, as it’s practically every girl’s desire to have a romantic and memorable proposal and wedding. The reality, however, is quite the contrary.</p><p>It comes out that Nicola wasn’t overly thrilled about the wedding. She and Barnaby thought about it for a full 20 years because of this.</p><p>Barnaby hasn’t spoken his opinion on weddings, but Nicola has acknowledged that marriage to her felt more like a workday.</p><p>“The entire marriage ceremony reminds me a little bit of going to work. Putting on a pretty dress and makeup, learning lines, having your hair done by someone else… If you weren’t doing it for a living, I can see how that would be incredibly enticing “She spoke.</p><p>In all honesty, it makes sense from her perspective. Therefore, on their special day, there was no extravaganza. Instead, only their closest friends and family attended the intimate ceremony.</p><p>We suppose that Barnaby and his wife would form a terrific marriage with or without the wedding ceremonies given that they are still going strong as ever.</p><p>However, to give their son a sense of security, they made the decision to be married.</p><p>They have a 16-year-old son now, and Nicola still remembers how his birth altered their life. She stated:</p><p>“However, you are unaware of how drastically your life will alter.”</p><p>It does alter, but the alteration is for the better.</p><p>Barnaby didn’t have an issue with it, but his wife was concerned that she wouldn’t get employment offers after delivering a baby. But since the actress is still working in the field, everything worked out just well for her.</p><p>Due to their shared professional history, the gifted couple supports and respects one another.</p><p>When Henry was a little child and Nicola had to work on set, Kay would take care of the child and carry him in a trailer away so that his partner could concentrate on their respective tasks.</p><p>Nicola’s wedding may not have gone as planned, but at least she found a dreamy man in Barnaby.</p><p>Kay has been quite idle in the industry lately, but Nicola Walker may be seen in<strong> “The Split” </strong>and <strong>“Annika.”</strong></p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a> <a href=# rel=tag>film actor</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Narrator</a></span> <a href=#><img src alt="Kevin Sussman" title="Kevin Sussman" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Kevin Sussman</a></h3>Who is Kevin Sussman?
