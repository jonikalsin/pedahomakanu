But to grow up costs the earth, the earth. It means you take responsibility for the time you take up, for the space you occupy. It’s serious business. And you find out what it costs us to love and to lose, to dare and to fail. And maybe even more, to succeed.”</p><p>Corley-Bennett added in the caption: “I hope one day, we all choose to grow up.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/04/chance-rapper-acid-rap-10th-anniversary-concert-saba-250x142.jpg alt="Chance The Rapper Announces ‘Acid Rap’ 10th Anniversary Concert With Saba" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Chance The Rapper Announces ‘Acid Rap’ 10th Anniversary Concert With Saba</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>April 25, 2023</p></a><p>As for Chance, <a href=# rel=noopener>he seemed to respond to the controversy via his Instagram Stories</a> on Friday (April 28), sharing a clip of comedian Bill Burr in which Burr spoke candidly about his own marriage.</p><p>“I love my wife to death.
