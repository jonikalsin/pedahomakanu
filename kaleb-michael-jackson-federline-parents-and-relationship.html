American singer and actress Shar Jackson is his mother. Her acting career began when she appeared in several TV episodes and series, including My So-Called Life and Bernie Mac Show. She became well-known, nevertheless, because of her portrayal of Niecy Jackson in the UNP sitcom Moesha. In 2007, she was also crowned a Celebrity Rap Superstar.</p><p>She has also acted in reality TV shows The Ex-Wives Club and the Nickelodeon film Good Burger. She has starred in TV shows as well as the film Steppin: The Movie. In addition to her work in television, Sarh enjoys music. Before splitting up in 2002, Kaleb’s mother was a part of the girl group Mpulz, which only put out one song.</p><p>However, his father, Kevin Federline, is a well-known singer and former backup dancer from the United States. He began his career providing backing dances for well-known singers, such as Pink, Justin Timberlake, Destiny’s Child, Michael Jackson, and others.

Together, they were parents to two children from their relationship. On July 31, 2002, Kaleb’s mother gave birth to his elder sister.</p><p>But Kaleb’s father abandoned his mother and started seeing Britney Spears when she was eight months pregnant with him. Moesha’s star had to go through a very trying period because Kevin abruptly left her and abandoned her when she needed him most. The singer/actress was devastated and said that Britney was to fault for their breakup.</p><p>It was equivalent to dissolving a family, not just a romantic partnership. In passing, I know Britney. We’ve met at a few gatherings, and each time we say, “She knows who I am, she knows I’m his girlfriend.”</p><p>Kevin later expressed his regret to her on the Celebrity Fit Club season finale, saying, “I was selfish, but I want to let you know that I am sorry.”</p><h2><span id=The_Star_Child_Parenting_Styles_Admired_by_Mother_Kevin_Federline>The Star Child Parenting Styles Admired by Mother: Kevin Federline</span></h2><p>She still thinks highly of her ex-fiance since he supported her kids even after they broke up. Their children have been raised by both of them as parents. Regarding her previous partner, Kevin Federline, Shar Jackson stated in an interview with The Insider,</p><p>He’s a kind man. Sure, he’s made mistakes, but everyone else isn’t facing global criticism for their transgressions. Their education is covered by him, and they attend a highly costly private school.</p><h2><span id=How_Did_Kaleb8217s_Mother_and_Father_Live_After_Their_Divorce_Do_They_Still_Have_a_Relationship>How Did Kaleb’s Mother and Father Live After Their Divorce?

On the other hand, in 1992, the mother of the famous child dated Corey Jackson, her high school boyfriend. The two ended their short-lived relationship in 1995 after just three years together.</p><p>We can’t say the same, according to Kaleb’s father.
