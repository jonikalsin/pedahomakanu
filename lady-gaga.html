She was born in New York City, New York to Cynthia Louise (née Bissett) and Joseph Germanotta, an internet entrepreneur. Descending from Italian and more distant French-Canadian roots, Gaga is the eldest of two children. She attended the Collaborative Arts Project 21 (CAP21), a musical theatre training conservatory at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts. Gaga withdrew at 19, deciding to focus on her musical career. After signing – and being dropped by – Def Jam, she signed with Interscope Records to release her debut album&nbsp;The Fame&nbsp;in 2008. With hits like “Just Dance” and “Poker Face,” she was a household name by the time her EP&nbsp;Fame Monster came out in 2009. This was followed by&nbsp;Born This Way&nbsp;(2011),&nbsp;Artpop&nbsp;(2013) and&nbsp;Joanne (2016). But even six Grammy Awards weren’t enough for the artist, who moved into acting and earned a Golden Globe for her role in&nbsp;American Horror Story: Hotel.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>Lady Gaga is known for her music and outrageous, attention-grabbing performances, as well as her avant-garde style of dressing herself.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span class=celeb_profile_label>Personal Life:</span><br>Lady Gaga began dating&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Taylor Kinney</strong></a>, 35, in Dec. 2011 just a few months after&nbsp;they met on the set of Gaga’s ‘You and I’ music video in 2011.&nbsp;Gaga&nbsp;announced their engagement on Feb. 16, 2015 by&nbsp;posting a picture to Instagram with the caption: “He gave me his heart on Valentine’s Day, and I said YES!” It was announced in July 2016 that Taylor and Lady Gaga had broken off their engagement.
