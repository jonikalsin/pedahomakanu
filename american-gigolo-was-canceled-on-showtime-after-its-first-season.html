This Jon Bernthal star became one of the first programs to face the axe of mergers after a sudden merger between Showtime and Paramount+, something that the CW shows are all too acquainted with.</p><p>The merger resulted in a shift in perspectives and tactics, culminating in the cancellation of two other series. Let the Right One In and Three Women met the same fate as American Gigolo, although the latter two may find new homes on another network. This reimagining of Paul Schrader’s classic story of prostitution may face greater challenges than its fellow canceled series, owing to the first season’s dismal ratings and critical reaction.</p><h2>More information about American Gigolo</h2><p>It would be incorrect to suggest that American Gigolo was uninteresting in its heyday. It could never match the high standards established by the original films, which were written by one of the best in the New Hollywood era, but it just lacked conviction in its first season. We cannot guarantee that the series would have improved, but as it is, it will never get the opportunity.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/American-Gigolo-1.jpg alt="American Gigolo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It’s even more upsetting since the series had a rocky pre-production. It was given the go-light in 2016, but it didn’t come to fruition until many years later, thanks to a new producer, David Hollander, who has worked on shows like Ray Donovan. This was far from the conclusion of the story. After Hollander was fired for misbehavior, the new showrunner, David Bar Katz, too quit soon after starting the season. After great consideration, it was given to Nikki Toscano and Russell Rothberg.&nbsp;The tragic narrative of American Gigolo has continued since the sitcom will most likely never be seen again.</p><p>The series’ summary stated:</p><p>“Julian Kaye, a former gigolo exonerated after 15 years in jail for a crime he did not commit, confronts the difficulty of picking up the pieces while the detective who placed him behind bars strives to solve the mystery that led to his imprisonment. Julian attempts to reconcile his escort background with the man he is now by reuniting with his old sweetheart Michelle, his difficult mother, and other sex workers. He’s looking for the truth about the frame that landed him in jail all those years ago, and he’s hoping to reunite with his one true love, Michelle.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/American-Gigolo-2.jpg alt="American Gigolo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Gretchen Mol, Lizzie Brocheré, Gabriel LaBelle, Leland Orser, and Rosie O’Donnell appeared in the series.
