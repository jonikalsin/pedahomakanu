As a Rogue, you have to have high reflexes in the stealth position. And as your main focus is on Dexterity, your acrobatic skills should be polished. With a proper Rogue build, your starting class can be your finishing class without having to respec.</p><p>And in this build guide, we will talk about being the sneakiest Rogue with a balanced Dexterity and Intelligence-based build that will be proficient enough to handle any kind of situation in Baldur’s Gate 3. Without further ado, let’s jump right into it.</p><h2 id=best-rogue-build-in-bg3 class="rb-heading-index-0 wp-block-heading">Best Rogue Build in BG3</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Rogue-Baldurs-Gate-3.jpg><p>As already mentioned, Shadow will be your biggest friend. However, shadows can be found rarely, and all you need to do is sneak up on someone from behind with the intention to poke him but stab him instead and remind him to reissue his car insurance. However, stabbing him will also bring out his weaknesses. And that is the thing you will have to utilize for the later plot.</p><p>On top of that, you will have to be quick with your feet. That being said, you will also have to have a good command of the controls. Other than that, the skills of the Rogue class will pay you a good amount in deeds if your Intelligence level is high enough. Make sure to invest in that. Well, we were about to talk about that topic. Let’s dive deeper.</p><h3 id=best-ability-points-assignment-for-rogue class="rb-heading-index-1 wp-block-heading">Best Ability Points Assignment for Rogue</h3><ul><li><strong>Strength</strong>: 10</li><li><strong>Dexterity</strong>: 18</li><li><strong>Constitution</strong>: 11</li><li><strong>Intelligence</strong>: 13</li><li><strong>Wisdom</strong>: 13</li><li><strong>Charisma</strong>: 10</li></ul><p>We will focus on Dexterity. Being a Rogue is all about being agile and acrobatic. Then Intelligence and Wisdom will contribute evenly while interacting with the occurring events.</p><p>Constitution and Strenght will have each others’ back, and a bit less Charisma will do no harm to a Rogue. However, the max cap is 20 for each, so you should focus on Dexterity till the cap. Then, move to either Strenght or Constitution. Others can remain the way as it is.</p><h3 id=best-rogue-race class="rb-heading-index-2 wp-block-heading">Best Rogue Race</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Untitled-1200-×-675px-1-6.jpg><p>The Wood Half-Elf race can provide the nimbleness, cunning, and stealth that are perfect for a Rogue due to its Fleet of Foot and Mask of the Wild passives. These passives increase movement distance and grant Stealth proficiency, making them a valuable addition to the play style.</p><h3 id=best-rogue-subclass class="rb-heading-index-3 wp-block-heading">Best Rogue Subclass</h3><p>The Thief should be the best subclass if you are dealing with a Rogue. As a thief, your priority should be to sneak up from the shadow. And with that advantage, during combat, this sneak attack will add an extra damage bonus to your attack roll. And this will keep increasing till your Rogue level caps. On top of that, cunning actions like Dash and Disengage will express a bonus action with bonus XP.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=best-rogue-equipment class="rb-heading-index-4 wp-block-heading">Best Rogue Equipment</h3><p>The equipment includes 2 Shortswords and a Longbow, with Rapiers available for extra damage. Proficiency in wielding Longbows allows Sneak Attack. Armor includes Studded Leather or Spidersilk Armor, +3 Dexterity Modifier, and +1 AC bonus. Additionally, accessories include Haste Helm, Linebreaker Boots, and Amulet of Misty Step.</p><h3 id=best-rogue-features class="rb-heading-index-5 wp-block-heading">Best Rogue Features</h3><p>To start with, we will perform Sneak Attack, as our build is mostly based on sneaking. However, the Sneak Attack comes in two forms; Melee and Ranged. On top of that, a bit of seasoning with Cunning Actions will help you stay on your feet during heavy combat. You will have enough space to counterattack with ease.&nbsp;</p><p class=has-medium-font-size><strong>UPDATE: PATCH #01 (25.08.23)</strong></p><p>Astarion and the Zhentarim have improved the game, enhancing story flow, dialogue, and UI menus.
