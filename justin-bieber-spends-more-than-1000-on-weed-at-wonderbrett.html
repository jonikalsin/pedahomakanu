Loves how the stigma is changing. And he smokes blunts!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/justin-bieber-1.jpg><p>Bieber, 27, <a href=#>opened up about his past drug abuse</a> in his docu-series “Seasons,” including his first time smoking marijuana.</p><p>“The first time I smoked weed was in my backyard here — got super-stoned,” Bieber said in a voice-over. “And then I realized I liked weed a lot. That’s when my desire to smoke weed started, and then I started smoking weed for a while.”</p><p>But his relationship with weed became complicated when he went from using it recreationally to developing a dependency on it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/justin-bieber-2.jpg><p>“And then I started getting really dependent on it, and that’s when I realized that I had to stop,” he said in the series.&nbsp;“I don’t think it’s bad. It’s just that for me, it can be a dependency.”</p><p>However, Bieber also admitted to abusing MDMA and mushrooms, as well as sipping lean as a form of “escape.”</p><p>“People don’t know how serious it got. It was legit crazy, scary,” he shared. “I was waking up in the morning and the first thing I was doing was popping pills and smoking a blunt and starting my day. It just got scary.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV9nfXN9jmluaGljZLe2v9OipWaamZqvpr6MrKeeppSoeq670Z5kraCRo3pyfI9pZKimXayyprCMmqtmr5%2Bjsaa%2Bwaucraxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
