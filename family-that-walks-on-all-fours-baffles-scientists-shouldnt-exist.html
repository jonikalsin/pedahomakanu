These people cross that boundary.”</p><p>The Ulas family was described in the documentary as “the missing link between man and ape” — and a Turkish study suggested that “devolution” might have occurred, reversing three million years of evolution.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The Ulas family was described in the documentary as “the missing link between man and ape.” <span class=credit>60 Minutes Australia</span></figure><p>But Humphrey slammed that theory in the BBC doc, calling it “deeply insulting” and “scientifically irresponsible.”</p><p>The documentary also maintained the family’s “untold significance for every one of us” and claimed they “shouldn’t exist.”</p><p>Researchers at Liverpool University found that the children at the center of the study had skeletons with more resemblance to apes than humans and had a shrunken cerebellum, a condition that doesn’t usually effect other humans’ ability to walk on their two legs, according to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Star</a>.</p><p>However, while apes use their knuckles to get around, these humans use the palms of their hands, marking a significant difference.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The documentary maintained the family’s “untold significance for every one of us” and claimed they “shouldn’t exist.” <span class=credit>60 Minutes Australia</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Researchers at Liverpool University found that the children at the center of the study had skeletons with more resemblance to apes than humans and had a shrunken cerebellum. <span class=credit>60 Minutes Australia</span></figure><p>“I think it’s possible that what we are seeing in this family is something that does correspond to a time when we didn’t walk like chimpanzees but was an important step between coming down from the trees and becoming fully bipedal,” Humphrey suggested.</p><p>He also noted that since the children were not necessarily encouraged to stand after 9 months old, their development could have been affected.</p><p>The children were provided with a physiotherapist as well as equipment used to help them walk on just two feet, which led to significant improvements in mobility by the time Humphrey returned to Turkey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Fma3Ffm66utcuyZK2gkal6uK3LpKpmp55irq24jJ%2BmrqqjYq%2BissWlnKxlo5i2prrToqqtq12otbDBy52lrWWVrba0wI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
