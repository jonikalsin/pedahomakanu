It is not a safe environment for children.”</strong> Another user commented, <strong>“That’s really scary. Who posted this? And if it’s Paul and Karine leaking this, why? By influence? Staying relevant? Or is it a call from help from Paul? I need answers and they need a divorce.”</strong></span></p><h2><strong><span>Karine Staehle Married Life With Husband Paul Staehle</span></strong></h2><p><span>Karine Staehle met Paul Staehle online as explained by Paul how he had not best luck in his past relationships in his land, Kentucky so he looked online for love and met Karine.

We hired a babysitter to help us with the kids when we are working, or Karine is in college. She believes Karine should drop out of school and be a full-time mother. I do not remember the last time she came to our house to visit. In Brazil, Karine’s family loved seeing our kids daily. Here they seem to be a burden. I mean, it’s Halloween. I would hope she would at least see their costumes.”</span></strong></p><p><span>However, Paul’s stories are presented showing only him the victim so there’s possibility of having more to the stories.
